# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing sidebar navigation by implementing a collapsible sidebar using shadcn/ui's sidebar component. The current sidebar is always visible and takes up fixed space. The new collapsible sidebar will allow users to toggle between expanded and collapsed states, improving screen real estate usage and providing a better user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to collapse the sidebar to icons only, so that I can maximize the main content area while still having access to navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the collapse button THEN the sidebar SHALL collapse to show only icons
2. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN navigation items SHALL display as icons with tooltips on hover
3. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN the main content area SHALL expand to use the additional space
4. WHEN the user clicks the collapse button again THEN the sidebar SHALL expand back to full width with labels

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a visible toggle button to control the sidebar state, so that I can easily switch between collapsed and expanded modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN a SidebarTrigger button SHALL be visible in the sidebar header
2. WHEN the user clicks the SidebarTrigger THEN the sidebar state SHALL toggle between collapsed and expanded
3. WHEN the sidebar state changes THEN the SidebarTrigger SHALL automatically update its appearance
4. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN the SidebarTrigger SHALL remain accessible and functional

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar state to persist across page reloads, so that my preferred sidebar state is remembered.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user collapses the sidebar THEN the collapsed state SHALL be saved to browser storage
2. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the sidebar SHALL restore to the previously saved state
3. WHEN the user expands the sidebar THEN the expanded state SHALL be saved to browser storage
4. IF no previous state exists THEN the sidebar SHALL default to expanded state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the sidebar to behave appropriately on smaller screens, so that the interface remains usable on mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen width is below tablet breakpoint THEN the sidebar SHALL use overlay/offcanvas mode
2. WHEN on mobile THEN the sidebar SHALL slide in from the left when opened
3. WHEN on mobile THEN clicking outside the sidebar SHALL close it
4. WHEN on mobile THEN the collapse/expand functionality SHALL be replaced with open/close functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want keyboard shortcuts to control the sidebar, so that I can quickly toggle it without using the mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses Cmd+B (Mac) or Ctrl+B (Windows) THEN the sidebar SHALL toggle between collapsed and expanded states
2. WHEN the keyboard shortcut is used THEN the same behavior SHALL occur as clicking the toggle button
3. WHEN the sidebar is focused THEN keyboard navigation SHALL work within the sidebar menu items
4. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN the focus state SHALL be properly managed
