# AI Tax Research Platform

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that provides an AI-powered tax research platform with password protection.

## Password Protection Setup

The application is protected by a password system. To set up the password:

1. Add the following line to your existing `.env` file:
   ```
   APP_PASSWORD=AIGTM2025
   ```
2. The password is currently set to `AIGTM2025` - you can change this to any password you prefer

## Getting Started

First, set up the password protection as described above, then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You will be prompted to enter the password before accessing the platform.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
