Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) Classes:

Class 1 (4%): Buildings acquired after 1987
Class 3 (5%): Buildings acquired before 1988
Class 6 (10%): Buildings that are frame, log, stucco on frame, galvanized iron, or corrugated metal
Class 8 (20%): Most machinery and equipment, furniture, fixtures, outdoor advertising signs, photocopiers, and electronic communications equipment
Class 10 (30%): Automobiles, vans, trucks, tractors, and other motor vehicles
Class 12 (100%): Computer software, tools costing less than $500, and certain other items
Class 13 (Straight-line): Leasehold improvements
Class 14 (Declining balance): Patents, franchises, concessions, or licenses for a limited period
Class 16 (40%): Taxis, rental cars, and buses
Class 43 (30%): Manufacturing and processing machinery and equipment
Class 50 (55%): Computer hardware and systems software

Key Rules:
- Half-year rule applies in the year of acquisition
- Recapture occurs when proceeds exceed undepreciated capital cost
- Terminal loss available when proceeds are less than undepreciated capital cost
- Accelerated Investment Incentive provides enhanced first-year deduction for eligible property

Example Calculation:
- Computer equipment (Class 50): $10,000 purchase
- First year CCA: $10,000 √ó 55% √ó 50% = $2,750 (half-year rule)
- Second year CCA: ($10,000 - $2,750) √ó 55% = $3,987.50`,

## Research Process Framework
Tax professionals should follow a systematic approach when using AI tools for research:

### 1. Query Formulation
- Use specific, detailed questions with relevant context
- Include entity type, jurisdiction, and tax year information
- Specify the level of detail needed (overview vs. technical)
- Provide relevant case facts and circumstances

### 2. Source Validation
- Always verify AI responses with primary sources
- Cross-reference multiple authorities (IRS, courts, regulations)
- Check for recent regulatory changes and updates
- Validate jurisdiction-specific rules and requirements

### 3. Documentation Standards
- Maintain clear audit trails of AI tool usage
- Document AI tool usage in client files and workpapers
- Include confidence levels and limitations in findings
- Note sources and validation steps taken

### 4. Quality Control
- Review AI-generated content for accuracy and completeness
- Ensure proper citation of sources and authorities
- Validate technical calculations and interpretations
- Consider alternative interpretations and scenarios

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Over-reliance on AI without human validation
- Failing to update knowledge bases regularly
- Insufficient context in research queries
- Ignoring jurisdiction-specific variations
- Not considering recent regulatory changes
- Accepting AI responses without critical analysis

## Best Practices for Implementation
- Start with low-risk research tasks
- Establish clear protocols for AI tool usage
- Train staff on proper query formulation
- Regular review and updating of AI knowledge bases
- Maintain human oversight of critical decisions`,

Overview:
- 20% deduction for qualified business income (QBI)
- Available for pass-through entities (partnerships, S corporations, sole proprietorships)
- Reduces effective tax rate on business income

Qualified Business Income:
- Net income from qualified trades or businesses
- Excludes investment income, capital gains, and certain other items
- Must be from a U.S. trade or business

Limitations:
1. W-2 Wage Limitation: 50% of W-2 wages paid by the business
2. Capital Limitation: 25% of W-2 wages plus 2.5% of unadjusted basis of qualified property
3. Specified Service Trade or Business (SSTB) Limitation: Phase-out for high-income taxpayers

Specified Service Trades or Businesses:
- Health, law, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage services, or any trade or business where the principal asset is the reputation or skill of employees

Phase-out Range:
- For 2024: $191,950 to $241,950 (single), $383,900 to $483,900 (married filing jointly)
- Complete phase-out for SSTBs above the upper threshold

Calculation Example:
- QBI: $100,000
- W-2 Wages: $50,000
- Deduction: Lesser of 20% of QBI ($20,000) or 50% of W-2 wages ($25,000) = $20,000

Tax Impact:
- Reduces effective tax rate on business income
- Particularly beneficial for high-income taxpayers
- Requires careful planning to maximize benefit`,
